# RISC-V Decoder Design

This repository is dedicated to the design and development of a RISC-V decoder. The project involves interpreting and executing a select set of RISC-V instructions and integrating the decoder into a simulated non-pipelined CPU based on the von Neumann architecture.

## Project Highlights

- **RISC-V Instruction Set**: RISC-V ISA (RV32I, RV32F and RV32M)

## Documentation

To review the full development history and additional documentation, please refer to the main project repository at [Computer-Architecture on GitHub](https://github.com/Cameron29a/ECGR_5181.git).
