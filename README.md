# RISC-V Decoder Design

This repository is dedicated to the design and development of a RISC-V decoder. The project involves interpreting and executing a select set of RISC-V instructions and integrating the decoder into a simulated non-pipelined CPU based on the von Neumann architecture.

## Project Highlights

- **RISC-V Instruction Set**: The decoder is meticulously crafted to understand and execute a subset of the RISC-V instruction set, ensuring precise operation within the CPU simulation.
